WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a collection of communications protocols and application programming interfaces that enable real-time communication over peer-to-peer connections. This allows web browsers to not only request resources from backend servers, but also real-time information from browsers of other users.

This enables applications such as video conferencing, file transfer, chat, or desktop sharing without the need of either internal or external plugins.[1]

WebRTC is being standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The reference implementation is released as free software under the terms of a BSD license. OpenWebRTC provides another free implementation based on the multimedia framework GStreamer.

WebRTC uses Real-Time Protocol to transfer audio and video.

getUserMedia, which allows a web browser to access the camera and microphone and to capture media[22]
RTCPeerConnection, which sets up audio/video calls[23]
RTCDataChannel, which allow browsers to share data via peer-to-peer[24]
The WebRTC API also includes a statistics function:

getStats, which allows the web application to retrieve a set of statistics about WebRTC sessions. These statistics data are being described in a separate W3C document.[25]
WebRTC is supported in the following browsers.

Desktop PC
Microsoft Edge 12[2]
Google Chrome 23
Mozilla Firefox 22[3]
Opera 18[4]

As of September 2015, Internet Explorer and Safari still lack the native support of WebRTC but ORTC was already added to the new Microsoft browser, Edge.[6][7] Several plugins are available to add the support of WebRTC to these browsers.[8][9] As of April 2016, WebKit, the back-end engine for Appleâ€™s Safari has listed support for WebRTC as being in-development.[10]

Firefox 34.0 was released on December 1, 2014. It brings Firefox Hello, a WebRTC frontend for voice and video chat. Hello was discontinued in Firefox 49
